# Pre-work - Todo

Todo is an android app that allows building a todo list and basic todo items management functionality including adding new items, editing and deleting an existing item.

Submitted by: Rehan Mulla

Time spent: 5 hours spent in total for basic functionality
Time spent: 12 hours for additional optional/suggested features

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [1] User can **successfully add and remove items** from the todo list
* [2] User can **tap a todo item in the list and bring up an edit screen for the todo item** and then have any changes to the text reflected in the todo list.
* [3] User can **persist todo items** and retrieve them properly on app restart

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* Persist the Todo Items into SQLLite
* Improve style of To Do Items using a custom adapter
* Add support for completion due dates and display within list view
* Use a Dialog Fragment instead of an activity for the Edit Item workflow
* Added support for selecting priority(1-3) for each To Do Item and displaying in the list view
* Tweak UX by showing Different colors for Priority field based on selected value.
* UX enhancement - when the due Date = todays date, the Date is shown in red on the list view

## Notes

Adding an external jar as a library dependency was tricky.
